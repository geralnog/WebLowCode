    <h3>Pangolin</h3>
    <h5>Intro</h5>
    <p>
      Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order
      Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς, "horny scale"). The one extant
      family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis
      comprises the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia
      include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species
      range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct
      pangolin species are also known. Description Pangolins have large,
      protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known
      mammals with this feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins
      are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites, which
      they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals,
      meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which
      they raise for about two years.

      <b>Poaching Pangolins</b> are threatened by poaching (for their meat and
      scales, which are used in Chinese traditional medicine) and heavy
      deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked
      mammals in the world.As of January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin,
      three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as
      critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata
      and Smutsia gigantea) are listed as endangered and two (Phataginus
      tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red
      List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of
      Nature.
